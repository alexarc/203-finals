# M203 Projects

This repository contains the project specifications for the C++ course exams. Each team has its own project. 
Each project has goals separated as 3 tiers:

 - Tier 1 is a working version on the algorithms involved in completing the programs. It requires the application of the topics seen
 during the course. Completing Tier 1 entirely and without bugs is **necessary** and sufficient to graduate the course.
 - Tier 2 involves more advanced C++ concepts, using documentation provided in this repository but not during the course. It is also where the projects become actually interesting to write and use.
 - Tier 3 are ideas of features you can implement to continue the project further, if you wish to ace the test. You don't need to implement all of the features.
 
During the submission, please send **both** the Tier 1 completed (as compliant with the spec) and the Tier 2/3 version, so that I can test conformity with the specification. 

Each subject has links to related files where you can find sample I/O files for Tier 1 and documentation for how to complete Tiers 2 and 3. Feel free to copy/paste code from this repository into your project.
