# M203 Projects

This repository contains the project specifications for the C++ course exams. Each team has its own project. 
Each project has goals separated as 3 tiers:

 - Tier 1 is a working version on the algorithms involved in completing the programs. It requires the application of the topics seen during the course. 
 - Tier 2 involves more advanced C++ concepts, using documentation provided in this repository but not during the course. It is also where the projects become actually interesting to write and use.
 - Tier 3 are ideas of features you can implement to continue the project further, if you wish to ace the test. You don't need to implement all of the features.
 
These subjects are here to guide you during the process of completing the project. **It is not required to complete or conform to the feature set**, they are here to help you test and evaluate the level of completion that is expected of you. In other words, this is how I would do it if I was the one doing the project.

As a rule of thumb, I expect at least as much as Tier 1 completed to validate a project. Complete Tier 2 to get a good grade, Tier 3 to ace it.

Each subject has links to related files where you can find sample I/O files for Tier 1 and documentation for how to complete Tiers 2 and 3. Feel free to copy/paste code from this repository into your project.

Feel free to open an [issue](../../issues) if you think a project is lacking details, sample files, or sample code.
